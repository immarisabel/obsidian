Lost Lake,"Mar 23, 2014","Mar 16, 2014","I first encountered Sara Addison Allen when my boyfriend found a book that looked written just for me. Whatever with “don’t judge a book by its cover”. I judged that book by its cover and title; ‘The Girl Who Chased the Moon’. I loved it. This is the second book I read from this writer, and now she has become one of my favorite.
‘Lost Lake’ is about Kate and Devin, and all the characters included. Kate woke up from her long sad dream when her husband died and after her daughter finds an old postcard, she decides to go on an adventure in search of the happiness she once knew, to offer it to her daughter before they are both tied in the miserable life with her mother-in-law. Sometimes you go through life finding a place to fit in. In Kate’s case, she found it when she was 12, but she never knew it was it until she returned 15 years later. Lost Lake was about to be sold and all the residences knew, it was their home, every summer, new stories were born.
I can’t say enough good things about this book. It connects you to each character, each story, each ending. It drags you back and forward making you feel happy and sad for them. The story is not just about Kate or Devin, but about all the people who found family and home every summer at Lost Lake. Just like with all her other novels, Sarah makes an amazing job making us feel for each of the characters. Every time you think it is a secondary character, she offers you their story, and suddenly they become more important and real. It is almost like reading 20 stories in one.
Another factor I love from her writing is that even though it’s a contemporary story, it always involves a spark of magic. The kind that makes you believe in it. The kind that makes you think, “yes, this might have happen in real life.” The kind that makes you looks around you and try to find that spark of magic in your own life. The kind that makes you believe that maybe after we are gone, we are not really gone, but we become something else, something more, something we wished for the most.
This story is about hope and the chance to start over and rewrite your ending. After I began reading the novel, I read some reviews. It took me by surprise that when Sarah wrote this novel, she was going through a breast cancer fight. It is her statement, “this is my story, and I write the ending.”
Amazing book. Amazing characters. Amazing writer. Five out of five stars of course. ♥",9781250019813,,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384531031i/18464735.jpg,ebook,Sarah Addison Allen,Contemporany,205,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,read,EN

The Gracekeepers,"May 7, 2015","May 1, 2015","The Gracekeeper is one of those mystical and beautiful novels which transport you into another kind of world. The oceans have devoured the earth, leaving groups of islands around the world to fend for themselves. People divided in land and sea. Trees are sacred, wood is the new high currency and mammals as well as crops of any kind are in high demand and only available to a lucky few. Such as North's bear, one of the main characters.
Callanish, a land girl in charge of resting the dead, meets North, a sea girl with a bear. Is hard to write a review without going into spoilers. So let me just say this, it is worth it. The world is beautifully constructed and the characters are deep. There is no real bad or good guy. They are are survivors in a world that is hard to live in. And they all want one thing, love. In any possible, horrible, beautiful and surreal way.
At first I though it was just Callanish and North's voices. But then we started to read short chapters on other secondary characters, which made the story more interesting and added extra dept. You can compare it to the Night Circus's prose on wonderful things, but then with a touch of -Station Eleven's hope for a different future and adaptation- approach. It has a charm of it's own. It talks about love and family and home, and how we can build it, instead of waiting for someone to do it for us. And how we can adapt to an ever changing earth which is the only home we will ever have.
My final thought: if she is back at her graceyard, then wouldn't the messenger ever go back to her? I really felt he loved her truly. These kind of stories go on in your heart after you turn the last page.",,,,ebook,Kirsty Logan,Magical Realism,320,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,read,EN
The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender,"May 10, 2014","May 6, 2014","This is a book filled with beautiful enchanting prose. Strange events and stranger people through four generations of women and their love demises. From the first line until the very end, you are taken inside this beautiful melody of a story. Even the characters' names were both beautiful and strange. I began reading with an expectation in mind, a love story, a boy falling for an angel. I got an amazing story of love and sorrows which broke my heart over and over again for each and every character, except for Wilhemina. I think she was the only sane one, serving as their healer and guide. The way how she helped them process their sorrows in the end was an amazing touch. I can not talk much about this book without giving much away. Lets just say my new moleskine reading journal started with a bang and 6 pages filled with all the emotions this book cause me to have.

I write this piece with a bit of shame, also with a bit of pride, if that makes sense. I have to confess I do not rave over romance books. Though I do like romance, the exaggerated ideal of it in some books makes me cringe. My expectations for The Bronze Horseman by Paullina Simons were quite high; a sin I often commit when choosing what to read and of which I am trying to distance from. However, this book presented with a lot of promises, and at some point some failed to deliver. I state in advance, this is not a bad book, it is not, it just presents at some point that part of ideal romance books that I dread so much. So to summarize it, my heart was divided in this book. Keep reading to find out why, stop if you don’t want to be spoiled of the feelings I am about to share.",,,,ebook,Paullina Simons,Romance,637,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,read,EN
Outlander (Outlander #1),"Feb 16, 2015","Jan 25, 2015","Why I read this
I have always been a fan of Time Travel stories. Not so much of pure romance and even less highlander romance. However, I had to know what all the fuss was about with Outlander. Specially when I read the negative comments on rape and abusive scenes. As the book didn’t look like it to me. But it was so good to be adapted with an 8.8 rating in IMDb. So I gave it a try.
My Thoughts
The writing was great from the beginning. And as expected, the sexual content started right away. Though not so crude as later. So I was like, sure, this is all right. Further on what got me was the historical background. The talk about Gaelic myths got me interested as I love those kind of stories. And the dialog was very realistic with imagery that made me feel I was watching a movie.
Claire is strong and independent from the start and this remained so through the story. Jamie began to be introduced little by little as the narrator is Claire and her mind was not on him just yet. Which made it all the more interesting. The romance took a slow but sure turn.
The plot was introduced fast enough, evolving as the story went. And the romance did as well. Hand in hand. I think this is what kept me reading regardless of the crudity of the novel. The sex scenes were delicate until a certain point, one very nasty rough scene. I still wonder why the author chose that scene to be written in detail in comparison to all the sweet ones. The intensity of emotions, perhaps? In any case, after an awkward pause from that point, I kept on reading. And it got so good! The action was non-stop. The character interaction was hilarious, tender, brutal and all the emotional trills you can think of.
I know most female readers are like “I want a Jamie!” Even though he has high moral and is all gallant and brave and soft at the same time…
Final Thoughts
I enjoyed this book through and through. For a first book in a long series, it is anything but introductory. It has everything it has to have to be a stand alone. Loved that!
As for the opinions of many out there, it is not a book for everybody. You have to be open minded to read it. Put yourself in the character’s shoes, the historical context. Yes it is crude, yes it is bloody and sexual and cruel. That was part of the time and place. A tremendously done job by the author, I must say. But it is also a rewarding and emotionally strong read. If you can’t handle heavy reading, this is not for you. Even when I could I was flinching my face every few seconds reaching the end because of how sorry I was for them. At the end, a great sense of relieve and expectation for what comes next.
I doubt I will get on to book 2 anytime soon. As I have many other books in line and after those 850 pages I really want shorter reads now. Anything 500 pages or less. But I might read the rest of the books. I am intrigued on how they will cope with the chaos approaching the Highlands and their children.

It took me well into two weeks for various reasons. The days I would not touch it would be mainly because of seasonal headaches. But once I got to the last parts I just finished the whole thing.
“But just then, for that fraction of time, it seems as though all things are possible. You can look across the limitations of your own life, and see that they are really nothing. In that moment when time stops, it is as though you know you could undertake any venture, complete it and come back to yourself, to find the world unchanged, and everything just as you left it a moment before. And it's as though knowing that everything is possible, suddenly nothing is necessary.”
― Diana Gabaldon, Outlander

Red Queen (Red Queen #1),"Apr 17, 2015","Apr 17, 2015","I got this book on my way to NYC for holidays. I was going to wait for next year but as soon as I saw it I had to have it. My instinct is usually right when it comes to buying books compulsively. This time as well. I was expecting something entirely different. This novel was filled with political and conspiracy plots. More than just about division of races. More than just love triangles. I lived and loved every page. I was afraid of the hype, but it did not let me down.
The characters were perfectly imperfect. They betrayed me as well, I loved them and hated them as much afterwards. So twisted. All of them with their own motivations, desires and goals. They played their own games individually. Mare was perfectly imperfect, a bit more and she would have cross the line to unrealistic character. Thankfully she did not and it was awesome! Same with the others. Though she is your typically YA heroine, and you typical dystophian plot, of which I am more than often tired of, the twisted plots around her and the world building kept me reading.
It lives up to its hype. It is full with action and emotions. Emotions which will tear you apart or make you want to tear apart some of the characters. You feel the love, the longing, the betrayals. I read it quite fast as it keeps moving, making you want to read it all in one go. I highly recommend it and am definitely looking forward to the second book. Also, I see this book being turned into a movie eventually. Just hoping it does not disappoint me as the story develops.",,,,library,Victoria Aveyard,YA fantasy,383,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,read,EN

There is a beautiful madness in this book.
Cooper is a fat gay New Yorker who wakes up somehow in the City Unspoken, a city where mortals and gods come to die. A concept which will leave you amazed once you grasp the meaning of it. The plot is difficult to understand if you are of the impatient kind. But once you do you will feel the need to continue.
The end of death is coming and everyone will drown in their own madness. The true plot here is a deeper one on life and death, the way each character face this and their immortality. This leads us to complex characters from which even those appearing in one mere scene have you wishing to know more about them. The phase is constant and the views constantly change. Much like movie scenes.
I truly enjoyed this book. Is my kind of book and I am certain it is not everyone's kind. It is not a mainstream read, nor is it meant for you to connect on a personal level to anyone but the worlds. But these kind of stories are what I consider forsaken and underestimated jewels. I never marked a book so much with so many flags and sticky notes. I would not have minded if it was 600 pages long.",,,,owned,David Edison,Sci-Fi,485,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,read,EN
The Book of Strange New Things,"Jun 11, 2014","Jun 3, 2014","Michel Faber didn’t published a book for 10 years, it made me wonder if he was on extended holidays or just taking his time writing this wonderful book. I never heard of him before, but I was curious if it was a new author so I did some research. He wasn’t, he was just out of the scene for longer than I’ve been reading.
The book begins with a man and a wife who relationship is deeply bonded in love; for each other, Jesus and the world. What stroked me is how well developed these characters were. I even felt sorry for the absent wife, I felt every pain as I read her emails and sorry and angry at the same time at Peter. I was expecting a lot of fanatic religion and annoying moralist characters, but no. These were real human beings trying hard to keep and share their faith, with their own doubts and guilt’s. I have to say the religious factor in this book was perfect, not pushy and yet integral to the story.
When Peter, the main character, encounters the natives of Oasis they hit me as creepy and I was pretty sure something creepy was going to happen. But no, these creatures are also as real as we are all the more reason for me to keep reading. It was amazing how Faber managed to keep these natives different and yet similar to humans. At some point I thought of them as adorably creepy.
The writing style was fluid and every single scene was worth reading until the very end; which even though a bit short for me, was well satisfying. Stating how a good book does not have to end and can go on in your imagination. A story, a real story has no ending, but a new beginning. The open end and the questions I had left made me wonder if the author was planning a sequel. I hope not really. The world was so perfect; the characters so real, I think a sequel might ruin this effect.
All in all, an unexpected amazing read!",,,,ebook,Michel Faber,Sci-Fi,500,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,read,EN

"Station Eleven ","Apr 30, 2015","Apr 22, 2015","Once in a while you encounter a book that makes you think. Sucks you into it's words and touch your soul and makes you consider the questions of life. Such was a book last year with A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki. This year, it was Station Eleven, as of now. Who knows by the end of the year. But this is a book which makes you think about what it means to reach immortality in a dying world.
The story is about a traveling group of artists and a strange dangerous sect 20 years after the Apocalypse. Traveling from settlements to settlements, the Traveling Symphony brings a bit of color and music to those who live still in darkness and survival mode. Their quest leads them to recover one of their own and with it, the recovery of hope.
“But these thoughts broke apart in his head and were replaced by strange fragments: This is my soul and the world unwinding, this is my heart in the still winter air. Finally whispering the same two words over and over: “Keep walking. Keep walking. Keep walking.”
The story floats around before, during and after the Apocalypse hits. All characters are amazingly developed, with their own back stories and their own connections. Each one entangled in the history of the other, in each others own immortality. Jeevan, the contributor, the link between Arthur, Kirsten and Miranda. Kirsten the one who remembers them. Arthur, the one who will be forever immortalize in Kirsten's thoughts. And Miranda, in Kirsten's surviving books.
This novel's style can be comparable to The Clock Bones by David Mitchell. Where time flows from character to character and makes you want to know more. The words make you reflect on what you have, what you built, and what you will leave when all else is gone. And it will make you feel grateful for how far we've come as a species. My favorite part of the book was during the 'airport' chapter. It made me almost cry about how much we take for granted until it's all gone.",,,,ebook,Emily St. John Mandel,post apocaliptic,336,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,read,EN
