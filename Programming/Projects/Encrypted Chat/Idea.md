I want to practice multiple things:
- network
- encryption
- authentication
- message exchange
- deployment
- email?


1. **Choose Communication Protocol:** Decide on a communication protocol such as TCP or WebSocket. TCP is a reliable connection-oriented protocol, while WebSocket allows full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection.
    
2. **Server Setup:** Set up a Linux server with the necessary environment for running Java applications and handling network communication. You might need to configure firewalls, network settings, and security certificates.
    
3. **Encryption:** For encrypted communication, you'll need to implement SSL/TLS encryption. Java provides libraries like Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) for implementing secure communication. You'll need to generate and use SSL certificates for encryption.
    
4. **Client and Server Applications:** Create two Java applications: one for the client and one for the server. You can use Java's built-in Socket or ServerSocket classes for basic communication, or libraries like Netty for more advanced features.
    
5. **Client-Server Handshake:** Establish a connection between the client and the server. In the handshake process, the client and server can exchange encryption information and validate each other's identity.
    
6. **Message Exchange:** Implement the logic for sending and receiving messages between the client and the server. Messages can be simple text or more complex data structures, depending on your application's requirements.
    
7. **User Interface (Optional):** Develop a user interface for the chat client to make it user-friendly. You can use JavaFX or Swing for creating graphical user interfaces.
    
8. **Testing:** Test your application thoroughly to ensure that messages are being encrypted and decrypted correctly and that the communication flow works as expected.
    
9. **Deployment:** Deploy the server application on your Linux server and distribute the client application to the two computers that will communicate.
    
10. **Security Considerations:** Keep security in mind during the entire process. Use strong encryption algorithms, validate user inputs, and follow best practices for securing your server and communication.
