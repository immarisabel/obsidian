- create server (TCP server)
- create clients

1. **Create the Server:** Start by creating the server application. The server will listen for incoming connections from clients.
    
```java
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class TCPServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(12345); // Choose a port number
        System.out.println("Server is listening...");

        while (true) {
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept(); // Accept incoming connection
            System.out.println("Client connected: " + clientSocket.getInetAddress());

            // Handle client communication here (reading and writing to the clientSocket's streams)
            // For example: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
            // PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);
        }
    }
}

```
    
2. **Create the Client:** Create the client application that will connect to the server.
    
   ```java
   import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class TCPClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        String serverIP = "127.0.0.1"; // Replace with the server's IP address
        int serverPort = 12345; // Use the same port as the server

        Socket socket = new Socket(serverIP, serverPort);
        System.out.println("Connected to server...");

        // Handle communication with the server here (reading and writing to the socket's streams)
        // For example: BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
        // PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true);
    }
}

```
    
3. **Implement Communication Logic:** Inside the `while` loop in the server and the communication section in the client, you can implement the logic for sending and receiving data between the client and the server using the `InputStream` and `OutputStream` provided by the `Socket` class.
    
4. **Run the Applications:** Compile and run both the server and client applications. Make sure the server is running before you run the client.
